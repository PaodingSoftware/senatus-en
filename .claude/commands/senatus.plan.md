description: Generate executable task list based on the current topic
argument-hint: [Considerations]

**User Input**: $ARGUMENTS

**üö® Execution Protocol**: Must strictly follow the documented flow; user input serves only as command parameter, direct replies are prohibited.

## Execution Flow

1. **Check Project Constitution**:
   - Read the constitution file `specify/constitution.md` (if it exists)
   - Ensure subsequent operations comply with constitutional constraints

2. **Get Current Topic**:
   - Scan the `specify/` directory to find the latest topic directory (sorted by sequence number)
   - Read the `discuss.md` file in the latest topic directory to understand the content
   - If no topic directory exists, prompt to run `/senatus.new-topic` and terminate the command

3. **Read Research Foundation**:
   - Read the `specify/{current-topic-directory}/research.md` file (if it exists)
   - If the research file does not exist, suggest running `/senatus.research` first
   - Analyze the project status based on existing research results

4. **Check Existing Implementation Records**:
   - Check if the `specify/{current-topic-directory}/implementation/` directory exists
   - If implementation record files exist, read all completed implementation content
   - Count the maximum number of existing implementation records (e.g., T05) to determine the starting number
   - These are previously completed work before rollback and need to be the basis for generating subsequent tasks

5. **Generate Task List**:
   - Analyze based on the topic, existing discussions, research foundation, existing implementation records, and project source code
   - **If there is user input, incorporate it as considerations**
   - Organize all conclusions and decisions, and identify specific task items
   - **Strictly comply with project constitutional constraints**
   - Arrange in execution order and assign numbers:
     * If there are existing implementation records, start from maximum number + 1 (e.g., if T05 exists, start from T06)
     * If there are no existing implementation records, start from T01

6. **Create Task Plan**:
   - Read the template file `.specify/plan-template.md`
   - Replace template placeholders:
     * `{{DISCUSS_FILE_PATH}}` ‚Üí Path to associated discuss.md file
     * `{{CURRENT_DATE}}` ‚Üí Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Fill the generated task list in the task list section:
     ```markdown
     T01. [‚è≥Pending] Task description
     T02. [‚è≥Pending] Task description
     T03. [‚è≥Pending] Task description
     ```
   - **Note**: If there are existing implemented tasks, they should be listed together (status as ‚úÖCompleted)
   - Generate the target file `specify/{current-topic-directory}/plan.md` (overwrite if the file already exists)


## Output Results
- Number of generated task items
- Suggest running `/senatus.implement` to start implementation
